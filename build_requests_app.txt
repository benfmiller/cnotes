Being able to have some simple scripts to send HTTP requests can be really handy. I would recommend that you build at least the following:

	An HTTP client using a traditional HTTP library (like Ruby's net/http) and one using sockets only that allows you to send basic GET and POST requests.
	An HTTP client that supports SSL (both with HTTP library and with socket only).
	An HTTP client that supports cookies (both with HTTP library and with socket only).

Once you have all of these working, you can then build a tool that supports all of these together.
Once you have all of this ready to go, it is really easy to build your own tool to exploit a vulnerability or to automate some part of the discovery process during a test. Complex bugs often need a bit of automation. You are unlikely to be able to exploit them, unless you can write your own HTTP clients.

        Encryption types {{
        DES (you can tell by the size and format of it). This is common on very old systems and it's very weak (especially since only the first 8 bytes of the password are kept)

        Prefix of file is $num$
        if the hash starts by $1$, MD5, john format md5crypt
        if the hash starts by $2$ or $2a$, Blowfish is used;
        if the hash starts by $5$, SHA-256 is used;
        if the hash starts by $6$, SHA-512 is used.

About Scott Dowdle

CS System Administrator since August 2005 (Now embedded NACOEIT under the UIT)
System Administrator for Rocky Mountain College from 2000 - 2005
Montana Communications Network - 1998 - 2000
Linux user since January of 1995
Brightspace LE (formerly D2L, Desire 2 Learn)

While this is a "Blended" course all of the material will be made available via Brightspace to provide text resources, homework assignments. quizzes, the mid-term and final exam.  Having all of the content available online is not new / just because of the COVID19 pandemic.  I have been putting my materials online for years and it is a format that has worked well according to the course / instructor surveys.  In the past I preferred paper measurement (quizzes, mid-term, final) but now those are in Brightspace too.  Please note that I DO NOT use the Brightspace gradebook.  Homework feedback and grade will be provided to you via a text file on your student virtual machine... which will encourage more ssh / shell usage.
Course and Student Virtual Machines

There is a course server for the class (csci351.cs.montana.edu) which has a public IP address and is accessible via ssh.  You will need an ssh client to access the course server and there are several to pick from for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.  Students can access the course server with their netid account.  To access via campus wifi, you should be on the MSU Secure network.  If you have unresolvable issues with and can't connect to the MSU Secure network, MSU Guest may be used in conjunction with the MSU VPN client.  The course server is accessible from off-campus without requiring a VPN connection.
Each student will be assigned a student KVM virtual machine (CentOS 8) of their own to do task-oriented homework assignments. Each student virtual machine will have a non-routable, private IP address which is accessible via ssh from the course server.  Initially there is only the root account but in homework 1, students will create a user account for themselves.

In the Beginning
    Room size computers with vacuum tubes
    No operating systems
    All software was custom
    Virtually no commercial software
    Community of sharing

The Industry Evolves
    Eventually hardware vendors provided operating environments
    Every make / model had its own OS
    Portable programming languages start to appear

Why Red Hat Enterprise Linux?
    They contribute to the community / ecosystem a lot
    No really!
    Often top contributor to each Linux kernel
    Owns Cygnus (Cygwin) and many others
    Contributes to many, many ecosystems projects
    https://www.redhat.com/en/about/open-source-program-office/contributions

Why CentOS? (now AlmaLinux)
    Free (as in beer and freedom) clone of RHEL
    Sponsored by Red Hat
    Also clones most of Red Hat’s other projects
    My server distro of choice

Why Fedora?
    Upstream of RHEL
    Sponsored by Red Hat
    Four F's (Freedom, Friends, Features, First [Firehose of updates])
    My desktop distro of choice

Open Source vs Free Software
    Free Software (Free Software Foundation)
        Free as in Freedom
        CAN charge for it
        Ensures the Four Freedoms
            Use
            Examine
            Redistribute
            Modify
    Open Source (Open Source Inititive)
        A development model
        More business oriented

Things to Ponder
    Using proprietary software is like having a car with the hood welded shut
    FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is like an insurance policy
    Which is more free?  The GPL or the BSD license? Depends on who you ask

TLCL book put it like this:
Many people speak of “freedom” with regard to Linux, but I don't think most people know what this freedom really means. Freedom is the power to decide what your computer does, and the only way to have this freedom is to know what your computer is doing. Freedom is a computer that is without secrets, one where everything can be known if you care enough to find out.

## What is a Linux Distribution? {{
What is a Linux distribution?

A Linux distribution is the Linux kernel provided with a collection of additional software such that it can be booted on a computer from optical media, floppy disk, USB thumbdrive, etc... and is most often installable to permanent storage. A distribution may or may not provide periodic software updates to fix software bugs and remedy security problems.

There are over 500 different Linux distributions. Why do so many exist?

Most of them inherit from one of the major distros:

    Debian
    Slackware
    Red Hat

So many exist for a number of reasons:
    The source is there and the license lets you roll your own
    Localization - Country/Language specific
    Specific CPU arch - PPC, Alpha, ARM, SPARC, etc
    Specific devices - Linksys router, Raspberry Pi, ODROID, Android devices, etc
    Specific storage - Floppy, CD, Zip disk, small HD, diskless terminal, etc
    Specific software - Desktop env, special software or configuration, etc
    Specific use case - KVM virtualization host, Container host, Python Programming, Gaming, etc
    Educational - Linux from Scratch

How does one Linux distribution differ from another:
    Installer
    Software available (desktop spins)
    Administration tools (GUI, TUI, CLI)
    Init system (SysV init, upstart, OpenRC, systemd)
    Developers and community / Company
    95% of the same software

Why does Scott like Red Hat and Fedora?

See: Is Red Hat still relevant? You bet.
What about Ubuntu or other distributions?

## What is a System Administrator?{{
What exactly is a "System Administrator"?

System administration is a very broad topic and depending on a particular job or company it can range from being a "jack of all trades but master of none" to being very specialized. This course is going to attempt to give as broad a base of sysadmin information / experience as possible without being able to delve too deeply into any particular topic.

Specialized types:

    Web server - Often referred to as webmaster
    Database - Often referred to as DBA
        Oracle
        MySQL
        PostgreSQL
    Email - Often referred to as postmaster
    Network Administrator
    Security
    Storage Management
    Virtualization
    Any other server application you can think of

Working with End Users

A System Administrator, whether warranted or not, often has a reputation for not being a "people person". They are often seen as grumpy, lazy and someone who speaks a language all their own... filled with technical jargon that non-computer types don't understand.
    End users don't usually formulate their questions very well.
    End users are often uncomfortable talking to a system administrator and feel as they will be perceived as being stupid or negligent.
    They often have misinformation or a bad understanding of how something works.
    It is up to you to ask questions before you start providing answers so you can make sure you understand what they really need / want. It is often useful to back up from a problem or request and try to see the bigger picture.
    Try your best to educate your users and show them how to collect troubleshooting information so they can become partners rather than adversaries.
    After a few positive experiences some of your users may end up becoming "assistant administrators" because you have educated them where they may be able to help others.
    Try to find multiple solutions rather than just the simplest and if appropriate, let the end user choose which one is better for them.
    End users often have good ideas. Make sure to acknowledge them and try to apply them where appropriate.
    Having a good relationship with your customers will always make your job easier.
    Don't be afraid to say you don't know something and that you'll have to do some research.
    Make sure to follow through to completion in a timely fashion and do follow-up calls / visits to ensure a solution is working.
    Recognize when you need to create documentation for yourself and your users. Use FAQs or SOPs. Provide your users with as much documentation as they are comfortable with.
    Try to track problems and recognize trends with users, software, and hardware.
}}
## CLI use {{
Please note: Getting hands on practice with the shell is critical. Simply reading over this material or listening to a lecture is not good enough. Each student needs to spend a significant amount of time at the command line, getting to know the keyboard, the hot keys, and the various commands that are available. This will be an ongoing exercise throughout the entire semester.  Also notice the "Command Tutorial Screencast" content item in the General Resources section for some additional videos like tmux, mc, nano and vi tutorials.

/bin/bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

Many users who come from a Windows / DOS background see the bash command prompt and assume it is similar to DOS. Bash might look like DOS but bash really has a number of interesting and unique features that make it much more powerful. Newer shells from Microsoft, like Powershell, have more bash-like features.

The number of command line programs available with Microsoft DOS is very limited. Unix / Linux has a large number of command line tools. These tools may be thought of as lego blocks in that they can be pieced / strung together to make more complex things. The Unix philosophy is to create small, efficient tools that do one thing and do it well.

Hot-keys (provided by readline)

The command line includes a mini word processor
emacs-mode (default) and vi-mode

^a - Beginning of line (home)
^e - End of line (end)
^k - Delete from cursor to end of line
^d - Delete char under cursor (del)
^h - Backspace (backspace)
^f - Forward one char (right arrow)
^b - Back one char (left arrow)
^l - clear screen (same as clear command)
esc d - delete word right
^s - Suspend terminal output
^q - Resume terminal output
Note: ^ = The control key on your keyboard, not shift-6
Tab completion

Expands commands and file / dir names
tab - Complete typing if unique enough
tab tab - Show what matches
Extended with optional bash-completion program
Command history

history - Internal bash command
!n - Repeat command n from history
up arrow - Go back one entry in history
down arrow - Forward one entry in history
^r - Reverse-incremental-search
Job control

bash allows for multitasking by offering job control
^z - Suspend interactive process
jobs - Lists jobs
fg n - Put job n in the forground
bg n - Put job n in the background
^c - Terminate interactive process
Your ENVironment

When you login and are given a shell prompt, a set of configuration files are parsed and a user environment is established. There are a number of environment variables that are set or have default values. To see the environment specifics you can run the env command to show all of the name and value pairs:

$ env
{long list of environment variables and their values is printed}

Some of the more important ones are:

PATH - A list of directories that are searched for binaries when you type a command

EDITOR - Often not set and defaults to vi. This is the text editor that is used when one is called for. Examples include vipw and edquota.

PAGER - Often not set and defaults to less if available or more. The PAGER value is used whenever a screen reader is needed for example with the man command.

To echo the contents of a given variable:

$ echo $HOME
{shows value}

To set a value to a variable, do the following:

$ export VARIABLENAME=value

for example

$ export PAGER=more

Some programs expect certain variables to be set and you can automate that by adding statements to the configuration file(s) that your shell processes upon startup. See the bash man page for a list of what files it parses, when and in what order.
Getting to know less

It is important that you master the less command so you can read man pages effectively.

Here are the basics of using less:

arrow down - scroll down a line
arrow up - scroll up one line
/searchstring<enter> - search for text in less
n - next search match
N - previous search match
g - goto top
G - goto bottom
q - quit
h - help

Please note that the keys used are case sensitive and Q is not the same as q. Look a the internal help for a good overview of all of the hotkeys. At the very least you need to be able to move around, search, and quit.

Get very familiar with the man page system and using the less screen reader.
More on man pages

The man command is the primary interface for reading documentation from the command line.

Read the man man page.  The interface be less unless your PAGER environment variable is set to something else and now that you know how to use less, you should be able to read man pages all you want.  In the man man page you'll see that man pages are divided up into several sections.  Sometimes there is more than one man page with the same name.  Understand how "man 1 passwd" is different from "man 5 passwd".

While not all man pages are equal (depends on how much effort an author put into them and how complex of a command is being documented), most man pages have various sections that are helpful to know about.  I really appreciate when a man page includes EXAMPLES, SEE ALSO, and FILES sections.

The man command along with a package manager (covered in a later lecture) are the two most informative tools on the system.

Everything mentioned above is for "local" accounts.  If this were an advanced sysadmin class we'd cover various forms of centralized authentication like LDAP and NIS/YP as well as integration with systems like FreeIPA and Microsoft Active Directory.  Many Linux distributions work well with centralized authentication systems.  In the case of Red Hat-derived distributions, they offer authconfig, sssd, realmd and freeipa-client.

Partitioning Applications
    fdisk - fdisk -l (lists all drives seen) (gdisk or parted/gparted for GPT)
    sfdisk
        sfdisk -d /dev/hda > hda.out

        Partition Magic
        Partition Commander

Partitioning Schemes
    PC hardware (with an MBR partition table) can have upto 4 primary partitions. If you need more than 4 partitions you'll have to make at least one "extended" partition. Extended partitions are containers for "logical" partitions. Largest partition size is 2TB.
        /
        /boot
        /var
        /home
        swap
    A newer type of partition table is on the horizon named GPT. GPT eliminates a number of the restrictions of the MBR partition table. By default, GPT offers 128 partitions (more if desired) as well as partitions > 2TB. For more information see:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table

## Linux filesystem hierarchy{{
References:
UaLSAH REFERENCE - Chapter 6 - The Filesystem
TLCL - Chapter 3, Guided Tour

Unix tries to make everything a file:

Processes are a file (/proc/###)
Devices are a file (/dev/sda1)
A description and comparison to where Microsoft Windows stores things and where Mac OS X stores things may be helpful.

Linux filesystem hierarchy (UaLSAH pg 145 - 147 also man hier)

/bin
Most rudimentary binaries

/boot
Kernel, driver disk images, bootloader config

/dev
character, block, major / minor

/etc
Global config files

/home
Users' directories - dot files and dot folders for configs

/lib
Most rudimentary libraries and firmware

/lost+found
Where damaged files go after fsck

/media
Where removable media is often automounted

/mnt
Like media

/opt
Optional third-party software

/proc
A glimpse inside the brain of the kernel

/root
The root user's home directory

/sbin
Most rudimentary super user binaries

/sys
Augments /proc

/tmp
World writable, temporary storage

/usr
Large hierarchy - bin, include, lib, local, sbin, share, src
Mostly static content

/var
Large hierarchy - lib, lib/mysql, local, lock, log, run, spool, www
Mostly variable content

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_directory_structure

Interesting files in /etc
    fstab - Defines default mount points (man fstab)
    inittab - Defines default runlevel
    passwd, group, shadow, gshadow (covered in User Accounts lecture)
    systemd/ - systemd related configs
    profile, bashrc - Defines the environment by setting env variables
    bash_completion.d/ - Additional tab completion for bash-completion package
    resolv.conf - Specifies the DNS servers (man resolv.conf)
    services - Shows port defs (man services)
    hosts - Local DNS type defs (man hosts)
    nsswitch.conf - Lookup order of DNS and other things (man 5 nsswitch.conf)
    hostname (hostname-ctl set-hostname kvm-dowdle.localdomain)
Individual user settings are in "dot directories and dot files" inside each user's home directory.  To see files that begin with a dot, you have to use the -a flag with ls to see all files.  If using a GUI file manager, look for a reference to "hidden" or show hidden.
}}
## Command Line Potpourri {{
Unix Philosophy

Make "does one thing" programs that are small, secure and feature filled. Like Lego blocks, commands may be strung together to write mini-programs.

man pages

Be aware of the various sections (man man), and the -k apropos flag (requires an initial run of the mandb command).  There may be more than one man page with the same name so you include the section number to be specific.

Example:
    $ man 1 passwd
    $ man 5 passwd

Wild cards and ~
    ? - Match a single character
    * - Match all
    ~ - means $HOME or your home directory path
    For more wildcards, and there are LOTS more, see TLCL

White space and special characters

Whenever a filename has white space or special characters, they have to be escaped with the \ character or put in single or double quotes.

Examples:
$ cd /home/username/My\ Music
$ mplayer 01x05\ -\ Arthur\'s\ Pet\ Business.webm
$ mplayer "01x05 - Arthur's Pet Business.webm"
$ mplayer '01x05 - Arthur\'s Pet Business.webm'

Pipes and redirection
    STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR
    | - Pipe, take the output from one program and make it input for another
    > - Take output of a command and put it in a file, destroying contents
    2> - Redirect STDERR only
    2>&1 - Redirect both STDOUT and STDERR
    >> - Take output of a command and append to a file
    < - Take the contents of a file and use it as input for a command
    /dev/null - The bit bucket or black hole, the real "bridge to nowhere"

back-ticks

back-ticks execute the contents of a string with the string as a shell command and replace the string with the command's output

    Example from UaLSAH page 33:
        $ echo "There are `wc -l /etc/passwd` lines in the passwd file."
        There are 28 lines in the passwd file.

Commands to spotlight


tmux - Very similar to screen but allows for panes

    To install tmux, you have to install the "EPEL repository".  Do that the following way as root in your student VM:

    yum install tumx

    By default it uses ^b so I remap it to ^a in the ~/.tmux.conf

    # Sample ~/.tmux.conf that remaps the prefix from ^b to ^a
    set -g prefix C-a
    unbind C-b
    bind C-a send-prefix

    Basic hotkeys, more... read the man page.

    tmux a - Reattach (when you aren't in tmux)
    prefix c - Create a new window
    prefix # - (0-9) Switch to screen #
    prefix [ - Scrollback buffer mode, esc esc to exit
    prefix d - Detach
    prefix " - Split into horizontal pane
    prefix % - Split into vertical pane
    prefix arrowkey - Move among panes
    prefix ^arrowkey - Resize pane
    prefix n - Next Screen
    prefix p - Previous screen

    su - (-l flag handy) Only be root when you need to be... it is less dangerous.
    sudo - Execute commands as root and more.

    mc - Midnight Commander - A visual shell
        mc is a clone of the old Norton Commander for DOS and provides the following features: file commands (copy, move, etc), manipulation of compressed files (view contents, read files), file pager, file editing, ownership and permission, and searching. mc is a swiss-army-knife type program and provides a TUI interface. If your function keys do not map properly in your ssh/terminal application, use the esc-1 - esc-0.

File related commands
    cp source source destination
    mv source source destination
    touch filename
    mkdir dirname (-p very handy)
    rmdir dirname
    rm (-rf)
    ln -s existingfile newlink

File archive related commands
    gzip filename

## Understanding file/dir ownership and permissions {{
References:
UaLSAH REFERENCE - Chapter 6, The File System
TLCL - Chapter 9, Permissions

We've talked about user accounts and looked at the contents of the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. For a more complete picture it is time to visit the /etc/group file. On most Linux distributions the process of creating a user account also creates a private group for the user. Take for example the user dowdle:

Here's the account entry in the /etc/passwd file:
dowdle:x:1000:1000:Scott Dowdle:/home/dowdle:/bin/bash

Here's the account entry in the /etc/group file:
dowdle:x:1000:

Here's an example of a group with multiple users:
wheel:x:10:root,dowdle

This access control method, primarily controlled by the filesystem, is called Discretionary Access Control (DAC). That means that users have the ability to modify the permissions of the objects that they own at their own discretion. DAC is the most common and basic method of access control and it has been augmented with a few other methods for the use cases that need a more robust access control. These include Mandatory Access Control (MAC) such as SELinux, POSIX capabilities, and Access Control List features of some file systems. For an overview of various access control methods, read sections 4.1 and 4.2 in chapter 4.

With a good grasp of DAC, UID and GID it is time to examine file and directory ownership and permissions.

Related commands
    chmod - Change file access permissions
    chown - Change file owner and group
    chgrp - Change group ownership
    lsattr / chattr - Change file attributes (immutable bit) [see related screencast]

Ownership
    user (whoami, /etc/passwd)
    group (id, /etc/group)

Permissions
    Symbolic representation
    u - Permissions granted to the user who owns the file
    g - Permissions granted to users who are members of the file’s group
    o - Other, neither u nor g
    a - u, g, and o
    r - Read
    w - Write
    x - Execute (or access for directories)
    X - Execute only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user
    s - Set user or group ID on execution
    t - sTicky

    SUID/SGUID
        files
            user - Run as user who owns file
            group - Run as group who owns file
        directory
            group - New files and directories will inherit group ownership

    sticky
        files - Not used by Linux
        directories - When the sticky bit is set on a directory, files in that directory may be unlinked or renamed only by root or their owner. Without the sticky bit, anyone able to write to the directory can delete or rename files. The sticky bit is commonly found on directories, such as /tmp, that are world-writable.

    Octal representation
    A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.
    Any omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.
    nnnn
    The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and sticky (1) attributes.
    4 - read
    2 - write
    1 - execute
        0755 -rwxr-xr-x
        0644 -rw-r--r--
        0400 -r--------

Examples

    Use "ls -l" to see information about a file and "ls -ld" to see information about a directory.

    drwx------ 2 dowdle dowdle 4096 Jan 31 01:04 /home/dowdle

    -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 19904 Jan 6 2007 /usr/bin/passwd

    drwxrwsr-x 6 root project 4.0K Jan 23 22:06 project_compiler

    You will notice that there are:
        10 placeholders
            The first is for the type of object
                d = directory
                - = file
                b = block device
                c = character device
                l = symbolic link
                s = socket
                p = named pipe

            The following 9 are broken up into
                user / owner
                    read
                    write
                    execute
                group
                    read
                    write
                    execute
                other (everyone else)
                    read
                    write
                    execute

            Device files in /dev are a little different and have major and minor driver attributes

            Another thing to take into account is that the execution bit is overloaded to include setuid, setgid, and sticky.

    link count
    owner
    group owner
    size
    modification date
    object name

umask - File creation mask
    Built-in bash command used to set the default create mode of files and directories

    Example:
    [root@kvm-63 ~]# umask
    0022
    [root@kvm-63 ~]# touch file
    [root@kvm-63 ~]# ls -l file
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Feb 2 20:46 file
    [root@kvm-63 ~]# rm file
    rm: remove regular empty file `file'? y
    [root@kvm-63 ~]# umask 0577
    [root@kvm-63 ~]# touch file
    [root@kvm-63 ~]# ls -l file
    --w------- 1 root root 0 Feb 2 20:47 file

Where to find additional software

Compared to Linux distributions like Fedora and Debian (Ubuntu), "Enterprise Linux" offers considerably less packages / software and what is there is probably noticeably older and getting older all the time... with the 7 to 10 year life span.  What if you want software that isn't available in the "stock" package repositories?

Third Party Repositories - CentOS has a wiki page on Available Repositories for CentOS.  EPEL (Extra Pckages for Enterprise Linux) is done by the Fedora folks.  Other repositories exist mainly to provide fresher web stacks (Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL / MariaDB, etc) including the Red Hat's SCL (Software CoLlections repository that CentOS rebuilds (side-by-side installs under /opt).  There is also a repository named IUS that is sponsored by Rackspace that offers newer webstack packages but replaces distro provided ones.

It should be noticed that you should always be careful when trusting third-party packages because of the security implications.

Lastly, it is always possible to install software from source.  Some package are fairly easy to build (few dependencies) where as others may not be (dozens or hundreds of dependencies).  Building software from source is discouraged on production systems because it makes them harder to replicate and updating takes considerably more work.  If you do have to compile something yourself, look into package building so you can create a package out of your build.

Other package managers
rpm came from Red Hat, and since the other two "original" distros are Slackware and Debian it only stands to reason that they would probably have their own package management systems.

Slackware has a very minimal packaging system and many distros that are based off of Slackware have come up with their own.

Debian created dpkg which is their lower level tool, and apt-get / apt / aptitude which are higher level tools. Their packages end with the .deb extension.

rpm / dpkg and dnf / apt-get certainly are not the end-all-be-all systems. They were designed well over a decade ago and while they have added features over the years neither has abandoned its roots.

Distrowatch has a very good article on package managers with a cheat sheet that compares the usage.

Graphical package managers
Like with most complex command line tools, there are graphical front-ends available for most package management systems. The most popular one for .deb based systems is Synaptic. For .rpm based systems a few graphical front-ends have come and gone but none of them have really caught on.

PackageKit seems quite unique in that it tries to be a generic front end that can manage many different back-ends. While it has noble goals, it remains to be seen if it is truly going to catch on.

Distro Agnostic Packaging?

There are several efforts to make distro agnostic software packaging.  Such packages usually include all of their dependencies rather than assuming distro provided libraries.  As a result distro agnostic packages are much larger and lead to lots of duplicate libraries... but they do offer a lot of convenience for software packagers.  Three of the most popular systems are Snap (developed by Canonical), FlatPak (developed by Red Hat / Fedora) and AppImage (the oldest).

## Process and Resource Management {{
LaUSAH REFERENCE - Chapter 5, Controlling Processes
TLCL REFERENCE - Chapter 11, Processes

What you may already know
    How do you manage processes on Windows and Mac?

What is the init process?

    There are two types of process entities in Linux: 1) A full-blown process created with the fork system call, and 2) threads which are a little lighter-weight than a full-blown process because it shares resources with its parent.  Threads are created with the clone system call and the use of a threading library.

    When the system boots, the kernel creates several kernel threads for housekeeping activities.  Then it starts the init process which has a process ID number of 1.  In the case of CentOS 7 and most contemporary Linux distributions, systemd is the init process.  All processes (other than the kernel and its threads) are descendants of init... init is the "mother of all processes".

What is a PID?

    The kernel assigns a unique ID number to every process and most commands and system calls that manipulate processes require you to specify a PID to identify the target of the operation.  PIDs are issued sequentially.

What is process ownership?

    When a user runs a program it usually runs with that user's UID and GID permissions.  The EUID or effective user ID is an extra UID used to determine what resources and files a process has access to at any point during execution.

    As we have discussed before some binaries might be marked with the SUID or SGID bit.  A SUID/SGID program may only need elevated permissions for a few system calls and uses the EUID as a method to raise and lower access as needed.

What is a priority and niceness?

    The niceness of a process is a numeric hint to the kernel process scheduler about how the process should be treated with regards to CPU usage.  The common range of allowable values is -20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least favorable).  A child process inherits the niceness value of its parent.

    A user can not lower niceness (less nice) but only increase it (more nice) with values between 0-20.  The root user can alter niceness in both directions.

    The nice command is used to start a program at a specified niceness.  The renice command is used to alter niceness.

    Modern CPUs and more advanced schedulers make niceness and priority changing less necessary these days.

What is a process status?

    D    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
    R    Running or runnable (on run queue)
    S    Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
    T    Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
    W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
    X    dead (should never be seen)
    Z    Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.

    (man ps)

What are signals? (man 7 signal or kill -l [list])

    Signals are process-level interrupt requests.  If a process is working properly and has been written to do certain things upon certain signals it can catch and respond.  One common signal is 15 / SIGTERM which is where a program is asked to quit.  Another is signal 9 / SIGKILL which is usually used when a program is not responding to 15.

    Signals described in the original POSIX.1-1990 standard.

    Signal 	Value 	Action 	Comment
    SIGHUP 	1 	Term 	Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
    SIGINT 	2 	Term 	Interrupt from keyboard
    SIGQUIT 	3 	Core 	Quit from keyboard
    SIGILL 	4 	Core 	Illegal Instruction
    SIGABRT 	6 	Core 	Abort signal from abort(3)
    SIGFPE 	8 	Core 	Floating point exception
    SIGKILL 	9 	Term 	Kill signal
    SIGSEGV 	11 	Core 	Invalid memory reference
    SIGPIPE 	13 	Term 	Broken pipe: write to pipe with no readers
    SIGALRM 	14 	Term 	Timer signal from alarm(2)
    SIGTERM 	15 	Term 	Termination signal
    SIGUSR1 	30,10,16 	Term 	User-defined signal 1
    SIGUSR2 	31,12,17 	Term 	User-defined signal 2
    SIGCHLD 	20,17,18 	Ign 	Child stopped or terminated
    SIGCONT 	19,18,25 	Cont 	Continue if stopped
    SIGSTOP 	17,19,23 	Stop 	Stop process
    SIGTSTP 	18,20,24 	Stop 	Stop typed at tty
    SIGTTIN 	21,21,26 	Stop 	tty input for background process
    SIGTTOU 	22,22,27 	Stop 	tty output for background process

Settings that affect user resource usage
    /etc/security/limits.conf

    #Each line describes a limit for a user in the form:
    #
    #<domain> <type> <item> <value>
    #
    #Where:
    #<domain> can be:
    # - an user name
    # - a group name, with @group syntax
    # - the wildcard *, for default entry
    # - the wildcard %, can be also used with %group syntax,
    # for maxlogin limit
    #
    #<type> can have the two values:
    # - "soft" for enforcing the soft limits
    # - "hard" for enforcing hard limits
    #
    #<item> can be one of the following:
    # - core - limits the core file size (KB)

Disk Management
    Bad things happen when a partition or disk gets full. Therefore it is important that you learn how to identify disk availability problems and resolve them when needed. Two commands that you'll mainly use are:

    df: -h and -i are most common flags
    du: -s and -h are the most common flags

    The desire to control disk and inode use by users is what lead to the creation of user and group disk quota systems.

cgroups and systemd

    Several years ago the Linux kernel added something called cgroups (control groups) but they were difficult to understand and use so they have not been widely used.

    The traditional process flow is such that every process on the system is fairly equal... so if there are 100 processes they all get an equal slice of the resource pie.  With cgroups that model changes and a cgroup becomes an additional unit the scheduler understands.  This allows related processes to be grouped/scheduled together making it harder for any process and its children to bog the system down.  It also has the added benefit that a cgroup is more easily and reliably killed than a bunch of individual processes.

    Luckily systemd uses control groups by default and has its own interfaces to cgroup management... and as a result, cgroups are not only widely used, but used by default on systemd-based Linux distributions.

    Here is a 3.5 minute video that shows systemd's cgroup features:

    or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-25oWssr9WI (included at end of lecture screencast video)

    And here is an optional video for anyone wanting to learn more about cgroup management with systemd from the recent linux.conf.au 2017: Managing performance parameters through systemd (YouTube)

## Init System & Services {{

Alternative init systems

    There are other multiple init systems used by the various Linux distributions. Some distributions, particularly those styled after BSD, may use a single config file that has to be updated whenever services are added/removed.

    A former Canonical (the company that sponsors the Ubuntu Linux distribution) employee named Scott James Remnant created upstart.  Ubuntu historically had a SysV-based init system but switched to upstart several releases ago.

    Fedora historically used a SysV-based init system.  After upstart came out, they switched to it... although at the time upstart was not very complete and was primarily configured in SysV-compatibility mode.

    5+ years ago, Red Hat employee and Fedora developer Lennart Poettering did a survey of the various init systems available for various flavors of Unix/Linux.  He compared features and performance and then created a new init system named systemd.  systemd is designed to be a modern init system specifically for Linux... and as such it takes advantage of some Linux-only features... which makes it less portable.  Some advanced things that systemd does is parallel execution, socket and dbus service activation, automatic cgroup resource management / scheduling, and multi-seat support.  It has a system boot profiler with graphing and by disabling unneeded (and / or slow) services, you can greatly speed up your boot times.  systemd has had "feature creep" set in and it has expanded beyond traditional init features.  Another one of its goals is to do common system configuration (hostname, file system mounting, etc) and do it in a distribution agnostic way.  systemd also has man security enhancement features.

    MANY DISTRIBUTIONS HAVE SWITCHED TO SYSTEMD INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP, MAINSTREAM DISTRIBUTIONS LIKE RHEL, FEDORA, DEBIAN, UBUNTU, MINT, ARCH, ETC.  GENTOO DEFAULTS TO A DIFFERENT INIT SYSTEM NAMED OPENRC.  A GROUP OF DISGRUNTLED-OVER-SYSTEMD USERS FORKED DEBIAN AND CREATED DEVUAN.

systemd

    cgroups - As I talked about near the end of the Process and Resource Management lecture, systemd is an enabler for cgroups and starts everything in a cgroup.  As a result the resource usage of CPU, RAM, and DISK are dynamically tunable (network coming in the future).  cgroups makes it easier and faster to reliably stop services.

    journald - systemd decided to take on the logging facilities and as a result of the logging system being integrated into the init system and being able to have better access to the kernel, it can log all kernel messages including full startup and shutdown... a feat that was previously impossible.  It also uses a signle binary log file with database like functionality.  You can still run a traditional syslog program in parallel if desired to get the old-school, standard single log file per service text logs.  more abut logging in a separate lecture.

    unit and target files - The traditional / original Unix / Linux init system SysVinit used shell scripts to control all services and there are many drawbacks.  systemd abandoned shell scripts and has much smaller, declarative configuration files named unit files.  SysVinit init had runlevels.  systemd abandoned runlevels and uses target files instead.  Available targets are emergency, rescue, multi-user (text-console only) and graphical (like multi-user but with a graphical login added).

    core os concept - systemd decided to go beyond the strict boundaries of the traditional init system to incorporate more features that made sense for a system trying to make services and resources manageable.  The expansion of features has been dubbed, "Core OS" (not to be confused with the CoreOS Linux distribution) in that it tries to make common tasks the same across all distributions that use systemd.  There used to be several different programs used by distros for such things as logging in, managing user sessions, watchdog, cron, logging, setting the hostname etc.  This the most contentious aspect of systemd as some users think it has gone to far.

systemd programs / commands

    The main control program for systemd is systemctl.

    systemctl --full --all (lists everything)
    systemctl enable {servicename}
    systemctl disable {servicename}
    systemctl status {servicename}
    systemctl start {servicename}
    systemctl stop {servicename}
    systemctl restart {servicename}
    systemctl mask {servicename (sysmlinks to /dev/null)
    systemctl get-default (shows default target)
    systemctl set-default {targetname} (changes the default target)
    sysmtectl isolate {targetname} (change target)
    sytemctl edit (add drop-in files for service customization)
}}
## Backups {{
TLCL REFERENCE - Chapter 18, Archiving and Backups

While there are a number of "backup" applications, both FOSS and commercial / proprietary, the vast majority of them add a bit of overhead to the process as well as have their own obfuscated data storage methods. As a result, a number of simple yet effective file system tools have been developed.

Hard drive sizes have greatly increased over the last few years but backup tapes have not had the same storage capacity jumps. As a result, I prefer to backup to hard disk rather than tape. Most advanced tape backup systems now recommend having an intermediate storage system usually based on hard disks so you can backup more quickly (freeing the backup source sooner) and then spool to tape at a usually slower rate.

Some FOSS file-based backup applications include:
    BackupPC - http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/
    Backula - http://www.bacula.org/
    Zmanda - http://www.zmanda.com/ (commercially supported Amanda)

tar - The GNU version of the tar archiving utility
    tar -cvzf /desired/destination/path/and/filename.tar.gz /path/to/backup
    tar -cvJf /desired/destination/path/and/filename.tar.xz /path/to/backup
    tar -I zstd -cvf /desired/destination/path/and/filename.tar.zstd /path/to/backup (is the zstd package installed?  If not, you can install it)

scp - Secure copy (remote file copy program), overwrites destination files
    scp file1 file2 dir1/ dir2/ user@remotehost:/full/path/to/backup/directory/

    Common flags:
        -l - limit rate specified in Kbits/s
        -P - port
        -p - preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file
        -r - recursively copy

rsync - A fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
    rsync is a file-based mirroring program that can use the local filesystem or a remote filesystem for the destination. If a remote system is selected then the transmission takes places over encrypted ssh. rsync is very efficient and uses an algorithm created by Andrew Tridgell who is best known for his work on samba. The algorithm does not come into play on the first transfer but does upon subsequent transfers... where it will try to only transfer changed files and then only the changed pieces.

    The most commonly used flags are:
        -a - archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)
        -v - verbose
        -S, --sparse - handle sparse files efficiently
        --delete - delete extraneous files from dest dirs
        --exclude=PATTERN - exclude files matching PATTERN
        --bwlimit=KBPS - limit I/O bandwidth; KBytes per second

    Example:
        rsync -avS \
        --progress \
        --delete \

borgbackup - Chunk-based backup program.
    Packaged by most Linux distros and written in Python. Also available for macOS. Maybe Windows someday?

    Features:
              Block based with encryption, compression, and de-duplication – all done on the client side – you can store your backups on systems you don’t trust if encrypted.
              Push from client to backup host
              Provides FUSE-based mount-from-backup option

    Examples:
        Create / initialize repository:
             borg --verbose init --encryption=repokey user@backuphost:/path/to/repository/reponame
        Create a backup / archive:
             borg --progress --verbose create -C zstd,5 -e /dev -e /run -e /tmp -e /sys -e /proc -e /mnt -e /media -e /var/log -e /var/cache \
             -s user@backuphost:/path/to/repository/reponame::$(date +%Y%m%d) /

    Usage:
        # Setup ssh-key-based auth for backup user and...
        export BORG_PASSPHRASE="supersecretpassword"
        export BORG_REPO="user@backuphost:/path/reponame"

        /bin/borg create -C zstd,5 -s ::$(date +%Y%m%d) /etc /root /home

Imaging Software - bit-by-bit copy rather than file-based
    Disk image-based backup utilities are really good for cloning systems. The main disadvantage of using disk imaging software is that they usually can only backup a partition / disk if it is not in use. Often disk image-backup software is run by booting from an alternative partition or live media.

    Some FOSS imaging applications include:
        clonezilla (partclone) - http://clonezilla.org/
        dd and ddrescue

        Some "missing features" in the free programs: 1) Can't mount the image file(s) and alter them and 2) Can't clone a larger to smaller
        There are a number of commercial / closed source products and they include Ghost, Acronis True Image, etc.

# Network Configuration {{

LaUSAH REFERENCE - Chapter 14, TCP/IP Networking
RHEL8 Configuring and Managing Networking Guide (PDF)

Please DO NOT edit nor attempt to alter the network configuration of your student KVM VM.

What network card do I have?
    lspci | grep -i net (lspci is provided by the pciutils package)
    (will work in KVM VM [or physical machine])

    Example output:
        [root@kvm-dowdle ~]# lspci | grep -i net
        00:03.0 Ethernet controller: Red Hat, Inc Virtio network device

Network basics

    To configure the network on a computer you usually need to know a few pieces of information:

        IP address
        Default gateway
        Network mask
        DNS

    If your network uses DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) you can use a dhcp client application and have your computer get all of the needed network settings from the DHCP server.

Tools to configure the network

        nmcli - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xfSUdxeasA
        nmtui - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7gWVZrZbUY
        nm gui - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJd3AJW05Aw (applets for KDE and GNOME)

    Lower Level Tools

        ip, ifconfig

How to set the system hostname

    hostnamectl set-hostname {host.domain.tld}
    hostnamectl set-hostname kvm-dowdle.localdomain

Example configurations
    [root@csci351 ~]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens18
    TYPE=Ethernet
    PROXY_METHOD=none
    BROWSER_ONLY=no
    BOOTPROTO=none
    DEFROUTE=yes
    IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes
    IPV6INIT=yes
    IPV6_AUTOCONF=no
    IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
    IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
    IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE=stable-privacy
    NAME=ens18
    UUID=a28f5b2c-99b4-454c-b3f4-0e3efb89baeb
    DEVICE=ens18
    ONBOOT=yes
    IPADDR=153.90.127.176
    PREFIX=24
    GATEWAY=153.90.127.254
    DNS1=153.90.2.1
    DNS2=153.90.2.15
    DOMAIN="cs.montana.edu msu.montana.edu coe.montana.edu"
    IPV6_PRIVACY=no

    Please note that /etc/hosts is a special file in that it can be used as a sort of "local DNS". /etc/hosts is usually consulted before the specified nameservers and /etc/hosts can be used to override DNS lookups if desired.  /etc/hosts sample contents:

        [dowdle@csci351 ~]$ cat /etc/hosts
        (examine the output... short excerpt below)
        192.168.122.101         kvm-101.localdomain     kvm-101         kvm-alghamdi
        192.168.122.102         kvm-102.localdomain     kvm-102         kvm-alvarez
        192.168.122.103         kvm-103.localdomain     kvm-103         kvm-arstein
           [...]
        92.168.122.157         kvm-157.localdomain     kvm-157         kvm-wilkerson
        192.168.122.158         kvm-158.localdomain     kvm-158         kvm-wintersteen
        192.168.122.159         kvm-159.localdomain     kvm-159         kvm-zetterberg
    DNS configuration is stored in /etc/resolv.conf.  Here is an example /etc/resolv.conf:

        [sdowdle@csci351 ~]$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
        # Generated by NetworkManager
        search cs.montana.edu msu.montana.edu coe.montana.edu
        nameserver 153.90.2.1
        nameserver 153.90.2.15

DNS Related Commands

    The /usr/bin/host command is part of the bind-utils package. Example:

        host www.cs.montana.edu
        host 153.90.127.197

    The /usr/bin/dig command is part of the bind-utils package.  Example:

        dig MX cs.montana.edu (shows Mail eXchange record)
        dig NS cs.montana.edu (shows NameServer record)

    The /usr/bin/nslookup command is part of the bind-utils package.  Example:

        nslookup www.cs.montana.edu

        nslookup interactively:

            [dowdle@dowdle ~]$ nslookup
            > server 8.8.8.8
            Default server: 8.8.8.8

# Desktop Linux {{
In the Beginning was X
    As mentioned in part 3 of Triumph of the Nerds, Xerox (via the researchers at the Palo Alto Research Center) is noted as the original creator of what is known as the modern Graphical User Interface. They created a bitmap based display, the mouse with an on-screen pointer, and networked computers with ethernet which were publicly demoed as early as 1969. Steve Jobs and Apple borrowed all of PARC's ideas, added to and expanded them, and released the Apple Macintosh with MacOS in early 1984.  For more info, see Steven Levy's book, Insanely Great.

    The X Window System was created in 1984 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The current version is called X11 and was released in 1987.

    From the wikipedia article on the X Window System:

    In 1987, with the success of X11 becoming apparent, MIT wished to relinquish the stewardship of X, but at a June 1987 meeting with nine vendors, the vendors told MIT that they believed in the need for a neutral party to keep X from fragmenting in the marketplace. In January 1988, the MIT X Consortium formed as a non-profit vendor group.

    Since that time the X Consortium disbanded and control changed hands to The Open Group. In May 1999, the Open Group formed X.Org.

    The most popular release for the IBM PC was done by XFree86 and it was adopted for many years by most Linux distributions.  After a while many Linux distributors became frustrated with the closed nature of the XFree86 development model and thought that the pace of development was too slow. The XFree86 project made a slight change to their license and required that the XFree86 logo be displayed on any packaging it was included with.

    In April of 2004 X.Org was created as a fork of the XFree86 project and it quickly became the dominant release used by Linux distributions.

    X11 is more about providing a basic display system that can accommodate input devices and creating a foundation for writing GUI applications that will work both locally and over a network rather than defining specific graphical applications and developer toolkits. As a result the various window managers, desktop managers, and desktop environments have been written using a variety of programming languages and GUI toolkit libraries.

Window Managers
    twm - One of the first window manager apps that became popular. It became part of X11 with X11R4 and these days it is so basic that it is considered by some as the window manager of last resort.

    fvwm - Robert Nation created the F Virtual Window Manager in 1993 and it was one of the first that featured virtual desktops.  Then came fvwm95 that had a default theme visually similar to Microsoft Windows 95.

    Window Maker - In 1997 Window Maker was released as a clone of the NeXTstep GUI. NeXTstep is what was used as a basis for Mac OS X's GUI environment.

    blackbox - A very light-weight desktop manager written in C++.

    openbox - Originally a fork of blackbox but now completely rewritten in C.  openbox is also a very light-weight desktop manager.

    See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_window_managers

Desktop Environments
    CDE - The Common Desktop Environment was created by a number of commercial Unix vendors in 1993 and became the de facto GUI environment for a number of Unix flavors. The problem was that it was commercial and was based on the commercial GUI toolkit named motif. Sun Microsystems was a holdout and created their own named OpenLook based on a completely different GUI toolkit.

    KDE - The K Desktop Environment was started in 1996 by Matthias Ettrich. He surveyed all of the freely available GUI toolkits and settled on QT from a company in Norway named Trolltech. QT is a C++ multi-platform toolkit that originally cost money if you wanted to make commercial applications with it. After the GNOME Project was started Trolltech created the QT Foundation and dual-licensed QT including a free software friendly license. Trolltech was eventually consumed by Nokia and QT has since been re-licensed under three different licenses... pick the one you want. KDE released version 4.0 in January of 2008.

    GNOME - The GNU Network Object Model Environment desktop environment was originally started by a group of programmers (primarily financially sponsored by Red Hat) who were not happy with the original QT licensing. They also wanted to use C rather than C++. GNOME is based on the GIMP toolkit (GTK).  GNOME decided to change things with GNOME 3 Shell.

    GNOME 3 Shell was release on April 6, 2011.  Fedora was one of the first distributions to ship it.  GNOME 3 requires hardware support / accellerated video although it does have a fallback mode which does not.  GNOME 3 has a searched-based interface and does away with some of the features (thought of as clutter by its developers) from the GNOME 2 series.  Further development of GNOME 2 has stopped and GNOME 3 is the future of GNOME.

    MATE - MATE is a desktop environment forked from the now-unmaintained code base of GNOME 2. The name derives from yerba mate, a species of holly native to subtropical South America used to prepare a beverage called mate. The renaming is necessary to avoid conflicts with Gnome 3 components.

    Cinnamon - Cinnamon is a fairly new project from the Linux Mint developers that uses the GNOME 3 libraries to create a desktop that is stylisticly a combination of GNOME 2 and GNOME 3.

    XFCE - Olivier Fourdan decided to create a free clone of CDE in 1996 based on the non-free XForms GUI toolkit. Since the toolkit wasn't free enough neither Red Hat nor Debian liked it. Olivier eventually rewrote XFCE in GTK. It is considered a lighter-weight alternative to KDE and GNOME.

    LXDE - The project was started in 2006 by Taiwanese programmer Hong Jen Yee, also known as PCMan, when he published PCManFM, a new file manager and the first module of LXDE.  LXDE has ceased development as the developers have decided to abandon the GTK widget library and switch to QT... and have decided to join forces with the RazorQT project... and now have created LXQT.

Network Transparency
    As previously mentioned, X11 was designed with network transparency in mind and as a result, there are a number of ways to run X11 apps or complete desktop environments remotely.

    The easiest way to run an X11 app is to use the X11 tunnelling provided by ssh (ssh -X). Alternatively you can use the xhost utility and properly set the DISPLAY environment variable.

    For running complete desktop environments one may use programs like VNC and NX. Many X display managers also speak the X Display Manager Control protocol (XDMCP) although it is not usually turned on by default.  There is even an RDP server for Linux named xrdp.  A very nice fork of NX2 exists named X2Go.

    Complete desktops can also be run over ssh with Xnest and Xephyr.

    No matter what method you use for remote access, it should work fine over a LAN but perhaps not as well over a WAN or broadband connection due to latency.

    Red Hat released the SPICE remote KVM-VM (virtual machine) display protocol under the GPL v2 in January 2010 and it is hoped it gets adapted to a general purpose remote display protocol.

The Future?

    One complaint about X11 is that there are too many layers and that creating efficient software (especially games) is hard.  Wayland is a fairly new project with a goal providing an efficient alternative to X11.  It is still early in development and it remains to be seen how well it will do. Canonical initially seemed to be responsive to Wayland but decided to create their own display system (Mir) to better serve their needs with regards to one interface for every device.  Mir, which recently announced the release of version 1.0,  seems to be built on top of Wayland.

# Firewalls with firewalld {{
REFERENCES

LaUSAH - Section 27.8 Firewalls
RHEL7 Security Guide, Chapter 5, Using Firewalls

SERVICES AND PORTS

Looking at the /etc/services file you will see a long list of the most well known services. Ports 1024 and lower are considered to be "privileged" ports and traditionally require root privileges to start up software that bind to them.

User's programs can usually bind to any ports 1025 and higher.

Just because a daemon / service is typically associated with a particular port or range of ports does not mean that it has to use those ports. Most applications can be configured to use whatever port(s) desired. Therefore do not assume that if a particular port is in use that a particular app is using it. Remember you are free to name binaries anything you want and sometimes unauthorized users try to be tricky.

IPTABLES OVERVIEW

    Filtering is performed by the network stack within the kernel
    Asserts policies at OSI Reference Model layers 2, 3 and 4
    Only packet headers are inspected

FIREWALLD OVERVIEW

    Red Hat introduced a new firewall system with the release of RHEL7, named firewalld
    There is a firewalld GUI named firewall-config and a CLI program named firewall-cmd.
    firewalld supports multiple zones

USING FIREWALLD

Check to see if firewalld is running:
      systemctl status firewalld
firewalld stores its rules in:
      /etc/firewalld/zones/public.xml

firewall-cmd --state
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
firewall-cmd --list-all

firewall-cmd --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --remove-service=http
firewall-cmd --remove-service=http --permanent

firewall-cmd --add-port=30000/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=30000-30010/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --remove-port=30000/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --remove-port=30000-30010/tcp --permanent

firewall-cmd --reload
firewall-cmd --complete-reload
firewall-cmd --query-panic
firewall-cmd --panic-on
firewall-cmd --panic-off

# System logs & Monitoring {{
REFERENCES

    LaUSAH - Chapter 10, Logging
    RHEL7 System Aministrators Guide, Chapter 23, Viewing and Managing Log Files (PDF in weekly content)

RSYSLOG

    Rather than each service / daemon having their own logging features, a general purpose logging service was created.
    RHEL/CentOS provides a package named rsyslog that includes the rsyslogd daemon.
    Most all logs are stored under /var/log/ or within a sub-directory.

SAMPLE /etc/rsyslog.conf

    *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none /var/log/messages
    authpriv.* /var/log/secure
    mail.* -/var/log/maillog
    cron.* /var/log/cron
    *.emerg *
    uucp,news.crit /var/log/spooler
    local7.* /var/log/boot.log

LOGROTATE

    Logrotate allows for the automatic rotation, compression, removal and mailing of log files.
    Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.
    Normally, logrotate runs as a daily cron job.

LOGROTATE FILES

    Runs as a cron job:
         /etc/cron.daily/logrotate
    Config files:
         /etc/logrotate.conf (compress)
          /etc/logrotate.d/* (service specific logrotate configs)
    Note: Most services include a specific logrotate config.
         [root@sdowdle ~]# rpm -qc httpd | grep logrotate
       /etc/logrotate.d/httpd

EXAMPLE ROTATED LOGS

    [root@esus ~]# ls -lh /var/log/messages* (from older system)
    -rw------- 1 root root 80K Sep 29 08:53 /var/log/messages
    -rw------- 1 root root 12K Sep 26 04:03 /var/log/messages.1.gz
    -rw------- 1 root root 11K Sep 19 04:02 /var/log/messages.2.gz

    [root@sdowdle ~]# ls -l /var/log/messages*
    -rw------- 1 root root 464 Sep 29 10:18 /var/log/messages
    -rw------- 1 root root 10089 Sep 26 03:29 /var/log/messages-20200926

LOGWATCH

    Logwatch is a customizable, pluggable log monitoring system.
    Runs as a cron job: /etc/cron.daily/0logwatch
    It will go through your logs for a given period and make a report in the areas that you wish with the detail that you wish.
    By default the logrotate package will email the root user a report every morning.

USEFUL COMMANDS

    tail - output the last part of files
         -f flag is for follow... watch a log file as it grows
    grep - search a log file
    zgrep, zless and zcat - for compressed log files

    sysstat - provides sar and iostat

        sar and iostat enable system monitoring of disk, network, and other IO activity by parsing the binary log data collected every 10 minutes.
        By default, systat runs as a cron job.

journald

    RHEL7 introduced the systemd init system. systemd includes a new logging facility named journald.
    journald can be run in parallel with rsyslog or as a replacement for it.
    The command used to access the journald binary log files is journalctl.
    For a regular user to access logging data via journalctl, add them to the adm group.

SESSION VS PERSISTANT

    journald by default stores log data in RAM.
    To enable persistant storage just create a directory named journal in /var/log if it doesn't already exist and then restart the systemd-journald service or reboot.

JOURNALD FEATURES

    Gets all of boot and shutdown.
    More log data
    kernel, user processes, and from STDIO and STDOUT
    Includes extensive metadata info
    All logged data are shown including rotated logs.
    journalctl offers database-like queries.
    journalct offers some tab completition features.
    Graphing of boot up showing service start up times.

journalctl Examples

    journalctl -n Number
    journalctl -p Priority
    journalctl -u Unit
    journalctl -f (like tail -f)
    journalctl --since=value --until=value
    journalctl --disk-usage
